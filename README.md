## evolution of this project üß¨
- I had a on-line spanish class, my teacher and I tried to find out a time which works for her (living in germany) and for me(living in Taiwan).
- Also, I wanted to practice connecting an API, so I made an [original one](https://yuwen-c.github.io/worldtime/)
- After that, I tried to show multiple timezones on the screen and turned out it had a serious delay on my app due to it's API.
- I needed an alternative, and indeed there were some: moment.js, luxon.js or even Javascript Date object.
- Out of curiosity, I studied about time and timezone and found out the meaning of existency of these libraries:
> get the present time somewhere is easy, get "a certain past time" somewhere is not!!
- Basically because it's so complicated and require a team with developers, historians to maintain the time database.
- Finally I choose Luxon.js to build my project, it works like a charm.
- To make this project more handy, I added the drag-and-drop function to it, and it became what it looks like now. üôã
